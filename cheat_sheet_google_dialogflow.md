## Why Google DialogFlow?

Google DialogFlow is particularly useful for a Swiss SME that wants to automate customer service interactions, such as answering frequently asked questions, making appointments, or registering orders.  
It allows companies to offer 24/7 multilingual support and reduce the cost of hiring human staff.  

Google DialogFlow acts as a middleman between customers and companies.  
It receives natural language input (text or voice), processes the intent, and returns a response (text or voice), or can trigger an action.

## Benefits and Limitations

### Benefits

- Easy to set up.  
- Easy to integrate.  
- Supports multiple languages.  

### Limitations

- Vendor lock-in.  
- Less control compared to open-source alternatives.  
- Concerns about data privacy.

## Cost Structure

### Costs depend on

- Number of requests (text or voice)  
- Version of Google DialogFlow (ES or CX)  
- Storage  
- Additional charges for non-Google integrations  

For a small Swiss SME with `~60'000 requests/month`:

- First `1000/day` requests: `free`  
- Remaining `59'000` requests: `~$0.002/request` = `(60'000 - (30 * 1000)) * 0,002` =~ `$60/month`
- Optional but useful Google Cloud services such as hosting fees: `~$0â€“10/month`
- Estimated total: `~$60-70/month`
